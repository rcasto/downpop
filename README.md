# downpop
Just a simple way to get a glance at download stats for npm packages.

To display the output seen via the CLI, [console.table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table) is used. So it may be subject to limitations based on the browser/environment it is ran in.

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed, you will in turn have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed and thus [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) should be available for you to use as well.
